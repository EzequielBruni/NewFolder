    <h1>NewFolder</h1>
    <p>A design system by Ezequiel Bruni, for Ezequiel Bruni.</p>
  </header>

  <section id="intro">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>NewFolder is a lightweight, minimalist design system / CSS framework, created to give users an easy reading experience. It was made to be used with blogs, wikis, and knowledge-base style sites.</p>

    <p>But really, it's a hodge-podge of styles that I've either written myself, or borrowed from elsewhere over the years. It's meant to be easy to customize in terms of color and typography, though I'll be sticking with the type I am using here.</p>

    <p>All layout must be done by the user. I ulike to use CSS Grid, myself.</p>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>

    A working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and SASS. A willingness to interpret my somewhat minimal code-commenting style. An inexplicable desire to use this hyper-specific design system/SASS framework that I made for my own personal use.

    <p><strong>API:</strong> A system whereby <em>enterprising young developers</em> make money from your users’ data. Remember that you can always destroy them by “tweaking” the API for “performance” because you “hate chronological timelines”.</p>

    <p><strong>Comments (in Code):</strong> In-jokes and clever insights that only total nerds will ever see. One day, someone will achieve <strong><em>true enlightenment</em></strong>, and the secret will written down as a code comment, and lost to an obscure GitHub repository.</p>
