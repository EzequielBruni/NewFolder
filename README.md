# NewFolder

A private design system that you're free to use, if you like it. It was designed for my own personal projects. It's based on SASS, mostly, and it's meant to be easily dropped in, and integrated  with any CMS you need.

## Features

* A pseudo-flat aesthetic
* SASS variables for changing your color scheme quickly
* Layout-agnostic. The navigation patterns mostly use Flexbox, but you can use CSS Grid for the overall page layout. God knows I will. The rest is up to you.
* Readable typographical Styles
* Various in-content image styles
* Form styles (still somewhat in-progress)
* Alert boxes for information, warnings, and success alerts
* Navigation patterns for nav bars, dropdown navigation, hamburger navigation, accordion navigation, breadcrumb navigation, and more.


## Things I'm still working on:

* Integration with CMSs like [Typemill](https://typemill.net), and [Bludit](https://www.bludit.com). Again, this is for my own personal benefit, mostly.
* Better comments in the code, and more of them.
